A project to evaluate the usage of CUDA/OpenMP usage on Piz Daint. The code simulates 2D particle dynamics with _binning algorithm_, where a particle is assumed to collide with at maximum 6 other particles in an L-shaped neighborhood. Collision detection then happens in each cell, which is further dispatched to GPU.
